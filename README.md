**Game rules**

1. At the start, Simon's game will randomly give you a signal ( one icon will pop up).

2. You have to repeat the signal by pressing the same icon. 

3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add a random one. 

4. You need to repeat these two signals by pressing the same icon lenses, in the order.

5. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

6. You need to repeat these three signals in the order.

7. Simon will repeat all three signals and add one.

8. Continue playing as long as you can repeat the sequence.

9. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon will automatically speed up.

10. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more then 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "REZZ" sound.  That means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends. GAME OVER.
